# Potenciometer to Keyboard Input

# ATTENTION
Note that for using the python code first you need to upload the right code for your arduino. The one I used is on the main branch and it uses the .ino extension.

# Step-by-Step
After downloading it, open your terminal, go to the directory that the .py file is and execute the following: python potenciometerToKeyboard.py

### It may change depending on your SO, usually it will tell you what the command is if this one does not work.
